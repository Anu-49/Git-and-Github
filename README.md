# About Git Github

## Local folders/repo - git bash

Git is a popular version control system. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, and has been maintained by Junio Hamano since then.
It is used for:
  + Tracking code changes
  + Tracking who made changes
  + Coding collaboration

+Manage projects with Repositories</br>
+Clone a project to work on a local copy</br>
+Control and track changes with Staging and Committing</br>
+Branch and Merge to allow for work on different parts and versions of a project</br>
+Pull the latest version of the project to a local copy</br>
+Push local updates to the main project</br>

### Working with Git
+Initialize Git on a folder, making it a Repository</br>
+Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder</br>
+When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered modified</br>
+You select the modified files you want to Stage</br>
+The Staged files are Committed, which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot of the files</br>
+Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.</br>
+You can revert back to any previous commit.</br>
+Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of changes made in each commit!</br>


## Remote repositories - gihub

+Git is not the same as GitHub.</br>
