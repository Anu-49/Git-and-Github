# About Git Github

Local folders/repo - git bash

Git is a popular version control system. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, and has been maintained by Junio Hamano since then.
It is used for:
  Tracking code changes
  Tracking who made changes
  Coding collaboration

-Manage projects with Repositories
-Clone a project to work on a local copy
-Control and track changes with Staging and Committing
-Branch and Merge to allow for work on different parts and versions of a project
-Pull the latest version of the project to a local copy
-Push local updates to the main project

Working with Git
-Initialize Git on a folder, making it a Repository
-Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder
-When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered modified
-You select the modified files you want to Stage
-The Staged files are Committed, which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot of the files
-Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.
-You can revert back to any previous commit.
-Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of changes made in each commit!


Remote repositories - gihub
